# Installation

MutTui will soon be available for installation through conda. But currently, to install either clone the GitHub repository or download the scripts from the repository

###Â treetime

MutTui requires treetime to be installed and this currently needs to be installed separately. **In a recent update, the main treetime has become incompatible with MutTui. This will hopefully be fixed soon but until then, it will be necessary to use an older treetime version or the version from [this branch](https://github.com/chrisruis/treetime)**
