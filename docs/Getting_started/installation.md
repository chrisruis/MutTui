# Installation

At some point, MutTui will be available for installation through conda. But for now, the only way to run it is to clone the GitHub directory or download the scripts and run them individually.

### Dependencies

Required:

* biopython
* numpy
* matplotlib

Optional:

* gffutils
* scipy
* sklearn
* umap
* umap.plot
* pandas

MutTui also required treetime to be installed. You can install treetime through the terminal by running:

```
pip3 install phylo-treetime
```
